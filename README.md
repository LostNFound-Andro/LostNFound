# LostNFound
Android application for Lost and Found.

The app provides google sign in, post found items, browse feed at the moment. Further changes will be updated here.

#INSTRUCTION FOR THE TEAM

To add any functionality, add it in the existing fragments.

To add a new menu item (like Profile, Feed, Post, Subscribe etc) use the res/menu/activity_feed_drawer.xml

To add a new instance/page/activity create a new blank fragment with factory methods, call backs and create layout checked.
  - For this fragment to be triggered, create a menu item, and make necessary changes to the FeedActivity.java

#Important

This is the new default branch. To make any changes, create a new branch and do not pull or merge unless discussed.
